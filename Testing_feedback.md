## Bet system to update:
I think there is a misunderstanding on the betting system.  
For each race, each player has to make his top 3 of the sprint, the top 3 of the race, and the glorious 7. Currently we have only 1 sprint winner, 1 race winner and glorious 7.  
And this make no sense that we can't select the same rider for sprint as for the race, one rider could win both in reality as these are 2 different races.  
Please adapt accordingly the code and what I have to change on Supabase for this to be taken into account.  

## Changes of home page:
I want to see the last race results on the home page.   

## Bug or normal?:
I tried entering race results for Thailand (way before the actual race, I know) and got this error: Failed to save sprint results. Is it normal as the race did not happen yet or is it a internal bug?  

## Feature:
On a player dashboard, if prediction of a race is done, I want to show it on his dashboard (instead of having "make prediction" button of the race, we could have "edit prediction" button instead?), as well as on the races calendar page of the players.
