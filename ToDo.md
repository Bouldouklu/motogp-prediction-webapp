## TO IMPLEMENT ASAP: 

### rider drop down menu
And possibility to show only the riders typed by keys. without taking accent into consideration 

### race and riders info fetched from API
before the race, the riders are fetched from the API, and the race information as well.  
hours local austria  
fp1 is critical to fetch asap   
shutdown pronos for fp1 + 5 mins  

### Race card
schedule to add to race card

### Glorious 7:
selection of 7 riders randomly chosen per race, or algorythmic. For example from last race or leaderboard only the 10 middle riders.  
player has to say in which order the riders will be placed, focused only on the first 3

### other idea than glorious 7?

### card prediction race
rajouter sur la card les tops 3 de sprint, race and glorious 7 une fois rentré. 

### leaderboard page
show offset comnpared to n-1 and top1
